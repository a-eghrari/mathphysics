Hi, I'm Ernest Yeung. I had been speaking with my current manager at work about ways I could improve my presentation and communication skills for professional and personal reasons, and he suggested I start a podcast. I didn't want the overhead of a podcast, so I'm going to try to start doing these unedited videos biweekly, where I talk about topics ranging from physics, math, computer science, propulsion, controls, anything that would help make humanity multiplanetary. If there are any strange or offputting ticks, unhelpful facial, body language.
